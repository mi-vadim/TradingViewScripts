I'm sure that many people, like me, went through such a stage as "building their strategy". This is when you sit and test on the history how you would enter or exit a trade.

Recently I was doing the same thing and realized that my "tests" involve night time, when in reality I would be asleep and not trading! So I decided to create an indicator that would display my "working hours" so that the backtest I conduct would be as realistic as possible.

Also this indicator is able to display sessions of major exchanges and forex working hours, so it will be useful not only for cryptocurrency lovers.

In addition, we don't always trade every day and, for example, I don't trade on Sunday. That's why we added a feature that "turns off" the day and does not highlight it in color if you're not planning to trade on that day.

And finally, I added a notification of the beginning and end of the trading session. A small thing, but it may also be a useful feature for those who like to sit at the chart!
